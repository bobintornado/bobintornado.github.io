displayTitle: Learning Resources Recommendation
---

Quite some folks had asked me for programming related learning materials recommendations, so I think I may as well just recommend for all and for once. 

I will keep updating this list from time to time as I learn more and more.

And for every single recommendation appeared in the list, I either PERSONALY USED OR USING them, or created it myself. :) 

Enjoy.
