Recently I am learning a geospatial course at my home university, and I am also building a simple web application as exercise. 

Following is an incomplete memo of what I have learned along the way.

* Leaflet.js is a good library for building map related applications. and you should check it out at <https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet>
* A basic code snippet of using leaflet.This creates a new map on DOM element whose id equals to "map" (which is usually a simple div),		  and add a basic Open Street Map base layer.

{% highlight JavaScript %}

map = L.map('map').setView([1.3569, 103.7779], 12);

L.tileLayer('http://{s}.tile.osm.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
  attribution: '&copy; <a href="http://osm.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
}).addTo(map);

{% endhighlight %}

* A few frequently used projection system 

	
	EPSG:4326 -- WGS 84 <br/>
	EPSG:3857 -- WGS84 Web Mercator (Auxiliary Sphere)<br/>
	EPSG:3414 -- SVY21 <br/>

	So what's the difference between these projections?<br/>
	In short the data stored in Open Street Map is EPSG:4326, but The Open Street Map tiles and the WMS webservice are in the projected coordinate system that is based on the EPSG:3857.

	Read this more at <http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/48949/epsg-3857-or-4326-for-googlemaps-openstreetmap-and-leaflet>

* When converting shp files into geojson, use EPSG:4326, which I found works well with leaflet. And I use GDAL to do so.
	
	````
	ogr2ogr -f GeoJSON -t_srs EPSG:4326 [name].geojson [name].shp
	````

* Use Leaflet 0.8-dev version instead of 0.7 stable before 1.0 rolls out. In my opinion, the 0.8-dev version has more features and offer better utilities.
