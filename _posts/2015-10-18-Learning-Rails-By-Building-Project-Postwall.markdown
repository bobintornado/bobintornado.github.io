In order to really "learn" Rails 5, I decided to build a semi-real-world project, so that I could really get my hands dirty. 

And the project, postwall, is roughly a Facebook group clone, cause I really like some features of it, and always want to build a similar stand-alone product.

Just like Facebook group, I imagine users could post stuffs. But instead of posting into group, they post upon a `wall`.

Instead of only building the project, I also decided to  document my thought and build processes for myself as references and records.

And of course, I used Github to host this project at <https://github.com/bobintornado/Postwall-backend>.

Let's get started.
