A list of hand-picked API documentation tools I think worth trying when documenting RESTful endpoints.

Trying is believing, click them all, and bring your own research. :)

1. [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) 
2. [Apiary](https://apiary.io/) 
3. [Readme.io](http://readme.io/) 
4. [Slate](https://github.com/tripit/slate) 
5. [RAML](http://raml.org/) with various tools, such as [RAML to HTML](https://github.com/kevinrenskers/raml2html)

I personally like the Swagger most. It's easy to *get*, easy to jump start and easy to share, since *the documentation is just a file*.

And I think a huge number of people also agreed with me, find them at [The Open API Initiative](https://openapis.org/).

You may also want to take a look at [3scale](http://www.3scale.net/) if you are looking for a complete package, whose documentation product is built on Swagger.
