2015 has passed really fast and slow. 

It's really fast as it is just a few seconds to go through it again in my head; it's really slow as a lot of stuff has happened. The experiences are so vivid that they make the days feel long.

Came back from my exchange to US in Jan, I dragged off my last semester from college and graduated around April. 

Right after my not-so-great university life I jumpped into my senior's [startup](https://keyreply.com/). Had a great time for around 4 months. Left due to company relocation(which is great for the company) and some financial/legal reasons.

Then I joined an [agency](http://www.tinkerbox.com.sg/) for another 3 months. The agency is really nice, I had a very happy time working there. Had a lot of fun and learnt a lot about best engineering practices.

But in the end I realize that I don't really enjoy working on other people's ideas and other people's codebase.

And I probably couldn't make my financial freedom by just doing agency work for other people.

Furthermore, I want to build truly great stuff. Not just good stuff. 

The worst thing is, I have some serious procrastination issue when I don't like the the project I am working on.

I think I must like the project myself, on a personal level. The product must be something that could ***make things happen*** and have some impact that matters. Best if it matters to me on the personal level.
