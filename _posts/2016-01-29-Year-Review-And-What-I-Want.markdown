2015 has passed really fast and slow. 

Looking back in flah.

I realized one thing, and one thing only. 

We either go full in or the life isn't worth living at all.

By full in I really mean it.

I steal an set of ideas from [Nathan Barry](http://nathanbarry.com/quit/) and decided to remind myself everyday.

> Have you given it your best effort?
> You want it badly, but that hasn’t been enough. So ask yourself, have you truly given this company the best possible chance to succeed? Or are you… 

> * Just working on it when you feel motivated?
> * Unwilling to invest money until you see progress?
> * Just giving the project a few hours a week as you have time?
> * Quitting too soon?
> * Constantly distracted by other business ideas?

> Just working on it when you feel motivated?
> Unwilling to invest money until you see progress?
> Just giving the project a few hours a week as you have time?
> Quitting too soon?
> Constantly distracted by other business ideas?
> If the answer is no, you haven’t given this business your best effort and every possible chance to succeed, then it might be time to double down. But if you truly have poured all your energy, attention, and focus into this for the last few years and it’s still not working, maybe it’s time to shut it down.

Live your life full.

Till next time.
