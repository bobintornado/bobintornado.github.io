I find time really files, and before I even noticed, it has already slipped through the cracks.

It's really easy to get distracted, to spend time on deceptively productive tasks(eg emails), to be pushed by life, and not working towards the most important things.

In order to focus on **the** most important	things, I think I have to re-calibrate myself on a daily basis.

I think keeping a diary is an effective method for me to review and reflect on myself daily, and keep myself on track.

That is why I want to build [Infinite Days](https://infinitedays.life/).

I want to make it easy to record a day and to scroll back to review the past.
