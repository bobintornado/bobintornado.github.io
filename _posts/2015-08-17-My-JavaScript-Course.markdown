A few days ago on Aug 13, I went back to my home university and hold a one day JavaScript enrichment course, teaching some intermediate to advanced concepts to my follow peers. 

I covered 

* A few operators \(\=\=\=,\!\=\=, ?\:, \|\|\)
* Function
* Closure 
* Promise
* Introduction to Node.JS and Express

I had a lot of fun in both teaching and recording my teaching, not mention watching myself. :) 

I have made the videos available on YouTube at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoB_ax1QYoE&list=PLnbVZVPYdHvGYIVvAP2PSwbdrHP8abyqJ>. 

Links to slides are also attached in the video description part. 

If you are interested, feel free to watch a bit and comment! :P
