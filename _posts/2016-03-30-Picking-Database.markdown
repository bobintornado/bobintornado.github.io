If you want to build modern high profromance, high concurrent and high scalable applicaiton, picking a database for it is one of the most important choice to make, if not the most important one.

There are a huge number of SQL & NoSQL databases out wild in your disposal, and all looks really good.

But you got to pick at least one database to store you main data set, if not multiple, so how should one chooses?

I'd like to say that the most important issue here is the data model itself and how want to query against the data.
