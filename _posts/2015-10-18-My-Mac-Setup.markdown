As a developer, I love using a UNIX-like system installed on a solid built machine, so I love using Mac for my development. And I configure my Mac in following specific way for both productivity and happiness.

1. I install Dropbox and create a new folder under it called "DownloadDropbox" and then configure the download path of Chrome to this folder (`~/Dropbox/DownloadDropbox`). So that all my downloads are available in all my devices, regardless they are my iPad or my Android phones.

2. I install Homebrew from <http://brew.sh>, and then use it to get packages like `Node` and `PostgreSQL`.

3. I install Sublime Text 3 (You SHOULD buy it if you haven't yet), and then bind it to `subl` command just like everyone else.

4. I install a bunch of packages for my Sublime Text and configure some settings to my preference.

5. I install 1Password and use it to manage all my passwords. 

6. I install Chrome with following extensions: Pocket, AdBlock, Vimium, ghostery and Pushbullet.
  * Vimium allows you to control your browser by keyboard, and it works pretty much like Vim.
  * AdBlock helps me block ads, and ghostery helps me avoid tracking.

7. I install Oh-My-Zsh and enable a few plugins.

8. I install `Solarized Dark` as my theme for terminal.

9. I install Alfred and disable spotlight. Yeah, spotlight is still a light year away from Alfred.

10. I imported my workflows to Alfred, and some of them are 
  * ⌥ + ⌘ + 3: open localhost:3000
  * ⌥ + ⌘ + 4: open localhost:4000
  * ⌥ + ⌘ + 9: open localhost:9000
  * double ⌃: open Chrome
  * double ⌥: open Terminal
  * ⇧ + ⌘ + p: open Sublime

11. I install Spectacle from <https://www.spectacleapp.com/> to control the window sizes with keyboard.

12. I install Alternote from <http://alternoteapp.com/>, which replaces Evernote Mac client.

13. I install f.lux to protect my eyes from <https://justgetflux.com/>.

This is roughly how I set up a new Mac.
