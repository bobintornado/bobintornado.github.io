Hey 

My real name in Chinese is 曹方舟，but everyone calls me "Bob". And I love it and actually more comfortable to be called as "Bob". :P

I like to think myself as a cool kid and cool kid usually do cool stuff. So I make a lot of cool things both and talk a lot cool stuff. Accidentally, majority of them are about development, particularly web development.

I should say my favorite programming language is Lisp but I haven't really dived it yet, so until now it's Ruby. Nevertheless, since I work on web, I wrote a lot JS, too.

If I am not doing cool stuff such as writing new post, I am probably reading some really awesome books. For example, recently I am reading **Thinking, Fast and Slow**.

I am currently studying in Singapore, and from time to time wondering what I am going to do with the rest of my life.

Shot me an email [at] bobintornado@gmail.com if you would like to have a cup of coffee with me. :)
