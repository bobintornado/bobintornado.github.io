Developer for bread, student for life. 

Working in a tiny startup in Singapore, mainly doing web development, now learning about Ansible. 

Wrote a lot a lot Java-script, really like ruby. 

Like cool stuff, obsessed with all kinds of `why` questions.

And trying to cut down some weight by running nowadays.
