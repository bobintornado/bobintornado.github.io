Hey 

My real name in Chinese is 曹方舟，but everyone calls me "Bob". And I love it and actually more comfortable to be called as "Bob". :P

I love making stuff, particular websites and web applications. 

My favourite language is currently Ruby, but most of my works are done in Javascripts until now. 

I have a wide ranges of interests, and read a lot.

I am currently studying in Singapore, and actively looking for career opportunities.

Shot me an email if you would like to have a cup of coffee with me. :)
