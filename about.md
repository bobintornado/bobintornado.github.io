Hey 

I am Bob. Yeah, that's me.

I'd like to think myself as a cool kid, and cool kid usually does cool stuff. So I make a lot cool things and talk a lot cool stuff. Accidentally, majority of them are about technology, particularly web development.

I should say my favorite programming language is Lisp but I haven't really dived in yet, so until now it's Ruby. Nevertheless, since I work on web, I wrote a lot JS, too.

If I am not doing cool stuff such as writing new post, I am probably reading some really awesome books. For example, recently I am reading **Thinking, Fast and Slow**.

I am currently studying in Singapore, and from time to time wondering what I am going to do with the rest of my life.

Shot me an email @ bobintornado[at]gmail.com if you would like to have a cup of coffee with me. :) 

And, oh, I am a night owl, so sometime it takes time for me to reply. :P
